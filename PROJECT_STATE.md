## What's NOT Implemented Yet
- Analysis upload + job creation flow
- n8n integration (webhook trigger + callback)
- Report generation + viewer
- Resend email (magic link, notifications, team invitations)
- Supabase Storage file upload with RLS
- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
- SSO/SAML for Enterprise
- Team management UI for organizations (functional, currently placeholder)
- Organization settings UI (functional, currently placeholder)
- Consent management UI
- User invitation flow (for org-level)
- Testing (Vitest, Playwright)
- Avatar upload in profile page
- Email templates created (React components) but Resend not yet integrated
- Team invitation email sending (invitations created but email not sent)
- Invitation acceptance page needs email notifications when invitation is accepted

## Known Issues / Tech Debt
- Sidebar user section shows hardcoded placeholder ("User") - needs wiring to auth session
- Sidebar organization label is placeholder - useTenant hook available but not yet wired
- Dashboard stats show "0" as static values until connected to database queries
- RLS policies are defined as SQL files but not yet applied to a live Supabase instance
- Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for middleware convention (will be renamed to "proxy" in future)
- useRole hook queries Supabase directly from client - consider server-side session enrichment for performance
- Profile form uses toast in render (should use useEffect for toast side effects)
- Team invitations don't send actual emails yet (Resend not integrated)
